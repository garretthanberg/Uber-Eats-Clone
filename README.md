## Introduction

This project is a feature-rich mobile application developed using React Native, Redux, Google API, YELP API, Firebase, and Yarn. The app aims to replicate the popular food delivery platform, Uber Eats, allowing users to browse restaurants, view menus, as well as place orders.

Please note that this application is meant for educational and learning purposes and should not be used as an actual food delivery service. The primary goal of this project is to showcase the integration of various technologies and APIs to create a feature-rich food ordering and delivery app.

## Features

* Restaurant Browsing: Users can explore a wide range of restaurants based on their location and preferences.
* Menu and Item Details: Get detailed information about restaurant menus, including items, prices, and descriptions.
* Order Placement: Effortlessly select items from a restaurant and place food delivery orders.
* Engaging Animations: Eye-catching animations powered by LottieView for an immersive user experience.

## Prerequisites

    Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
    React Native CLI (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
    Yarn package manager (https://yarnpkg.com)
    Firebase account for authentication and database setup (https://firebase.google.com)
    Google API Key for location search integration (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
    YELP API Key for restaurant data (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication)
